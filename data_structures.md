## Data Structures
The term data structure is used to denote a
particular way of organizing data for particular types of operation. 


We want to talk about data structures without having to worry about all the implementational details associated with particular programming languages, or how the data is stored in computer memory. We can do this by formulating abstract data types, they are defined only by the operations that may be performed on
them. We specify how they are built out of more primitive data types (e.g., integers
or strings), how to extract that data from them, and some basic checks to control the flow of
processing in algorithms.
